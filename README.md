Project
This project is a ALX portfolio project. This portfolio project will give us a chance to express who we are as a person and developer. For me this project will give me a chance to develop an app that is very close to what I am doing now and want to do for the future, which is to help the voluntary work with technology, so I would like to thank ALX and the team for giving me this opportunity.

Voluntary
People volunteer for all sorts of reasons – they may be out of work, retired, or just have skills and some spare time they want to use to help others but we should do voluntary work mainly for us not only to help others . Volunteering brings a wide range of personal benefits including enjoyment, a sense of purpose and belonging within the community, higher levels of life satisfaction, and a feeling of connection. Volunteering improves health and social relationships too.That is why I choose voluntary work for my project so that I can improve my health and give others the benefits and the experience voluntary work brings .

Volunteerism and Technology
Technology has become invaluable in every aspect of our lives - including volunteering.Through technology in voluntary work may not reach the level it should have been especially in Africa nowadays with people becoming more and more involved with smartphones there has been a great deal of change in people connecting with the broader world and technology. So by creating an app to the voluntary world in Ethiopia it would be the one way to contribute to make a change in volunteerism and technology . “Volunteers do not necessarily have the time; they just have the heart.” This essence of volunteering hasn’t changed over the years It remains a pivotal way to build strong and connected communities, promote equality and improve the world..people with good heart don’t have time and if they have time they don’t know how to get the cause that is related to them and the voluntary work that fit there schedule, so to resolve this issue and to encourage other people to volunteer technology is the answer.

Ethio-DEBO
DEBO is an amharic word meaning cooperation or working together. In rural Ethiopia people gather to do labor intensive works such as cultivation work, reap or irrigation work and they call this Debo.This word is strongly associated with cooperation and volunteerism that is why I call the project Ethio-Debo because the project is focused on volunteerism in Ethiopia .

Ethio-Debo APP
Ethio-Debo APP is a way to connect volunteers to voluntary work. The App designed to be simple so that people only get what they are looking for which is voluntary work.This App contains landing pages, volunteer forms and voluntary profiles that would be helpful for NGOs to choose from the voluntary applicant, so the landing page immediately direct to the project page the project page direct to the volunteers form. For the NGos there is one form page and one login page for the accepted and the registered NGOs to see the volunteers profile .
